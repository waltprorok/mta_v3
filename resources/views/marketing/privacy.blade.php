                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid is an automated studio for music teachers. The privacy and security of our
                    customers and all individuals who visit MusicTeachersAid sites and the sites of
                    MusicTeachersAid affiliates (“MusicTeachersAid”) are of paramount importance to us and we
                    are committed to protecting your Personal Information. This Privacy policy describes our
                    policies regarding the nature of the information we collect, how we use this information,
                    our compliance with law and regulation, and the security provided to prevent disclosure of
                    your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy also provides information relating to choices
                    you may have in connection with cookies, maintaining or deleting material you may have
                    created using our Services. This Privacy policy is effective immediately for new accounts as
                    well as existing users of MusicTeachersAid Services. Please carefully review this Privacy
                    Policy.</p>

                <h3>Changes to our privacy policy</h3>

                <p>This Privacy Policy may be amended at any time by posting the amended terms on the
                    MusicTeachersAid sites. All terms will become effective as of the date of the posting. By
                    your use of the Services, you agree to be bound by these terms and the terms of any amended
                    Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>Personal information we collect</h3>

                <p>Personal Information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
                    person, directly or indirectly, by reference to a name, identification number, location
                    data, online identifier, or other factors. MusicTeachersAid does not have access to and does
                    not collect Personal Information from third parties with whom you may communicate. We do not
                    release your information to third parties except as necessary and appropriate for us to set
                    up your account and process your transaction.</p>

                <h3>How we use the personal information you provide</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid uses the Personal Information that is collected from your application to
                    provide you with the Services. We may use your Personal Information to answer your
                    inquiries, enhance your experience with our Services, manage your account, and provide you
                    with support when necessary, including the troubleshooting of any problems with your
                    account. Your support requests can generate additional information such as the browser you
                    use and your device’s operating system. MusicTeachersAid maintains records of the support it
                    provides to improve its system and to respond to general issues. We do not release your
                    Personal Information except as required to process your transaction. We do not disclose your
                    Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or
                    services to you.</p>

                <p>Also, MusicTeachersAid cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private
                    parties to enforce and comply with law and regulation. We may disclose Personal Information
                    to government or law enforcement officials, or to private parties, that we, in our sole
                    discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or regulation, to
                    protect the property and rights of MusicTeachersAid, other users or third parties, to assist
                    in the safety of the public or an individual person, or to assist in the prevention of any
                    illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, including situations that involve the
                    abuse of our Services.</p>

                <p>In addition, you may authorize MusicTeachersAid to access your accounts with certain
                    additional social networking sites such as Instagram or Twitter. If you choose to access
                    these accounts, the designated social networking site will provide MusicTeachersAid with its
                    platform identification number for your profile, your profile name, and profile image.</p>

                <h3>Link to third party sites</h3>

                <p>The MusicTeachersAid sites may have links to third party websites whose privacy policies may
                    differ from those of MusicTeachersAid. Please be aware that third party websites are not
                    within our control. They are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions
                    about Personal Information you submit to these websites, please consult that site’s privacy
                    policy.</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid is committed to protecting the Personal Information it receives. However, no
                    method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee
                    the security of your Personal Information. However, we use a combination of online and
                    offline security technologies, procedures and measures to help safeguard Personal
                    Information against accidental loss, unauthorized access, destruction, damage, theft or
                    disclosure.</p>

                <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard the Personal Information
                    you provide to MusicTeachersAid. We use data encryption technology when data is transmitted
                    over the internet to our site. We have implemented an additional layer of encryption, and we
                    both password protect and limit access to all Personal Information.</p>

                <h3>How long do we keep your personal information?</h3>

                <p>You may delete your content at any time following the instructions on the MusicTeachersAid
                    site. You may also cancel your account at any time. Once cancelled, the Personal Information
                    we maintain and any other data will be wiped clean. The sole exception is information
                    related to prior billing history maintained by MusicTeachersAid’s affiliated merchant
                    service provider.</p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid uses tracking technologies such as cookies, scripts and tags to collect and
                    store information when you visit our site or use our Services. Cookies are small text files
                    placed on the web browser of your computers, smart phones, tablets, and other mobile

                    or change your browser settings to require notification each time a cookie is placed.

                <p>In the event you wish to delete or disable cookies, you may do so using your web browser. It
                    may be necessary for you to check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.
                    However, to the extent that Cookies remain on your web browser, MusicTeachersAid can deliver
                    faster service. Also, certain features listed on the MusicTeachersAid website may not be
                    available once cookies have been disabled. By visiting our site or using our services, you
                    agree to the use of cookies in your browser and HTML-based emails.</p>

                <p>We also use scripts to allow Google Analytics to collect and portray in graph form,
                    information about traffic to our sites and how you and others use our Services. The
                    information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated
                    and is anonymous.</p>

                <h3>Consent</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid requires your “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent” to
                    receive and process your Personal Information in the manner described in this Privacy
                    Policy. By establishing an account with MusicTeachersAid, or by using the Services, you
                    expressly consent to the collection, storage and use of your Personal Information as
                    provided herein. If you do not consent to our use of your Personal Information, please do
                    not submit your application or use the Services. We do not collect information from visitors
                    who do not use our Services.</p>

                <h3>Children's policy</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid understands that children require particular protection because they are
                    less aware of the risks involved with the collecting and processing of Personal Information.
                    Since the safety and privacy of children is important to MusicTeachersAid, our Services may
                    be used only by individuals over the age of thirteen in the United States. This age
                    requirement is consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).
                    The primary goal of COPPA is to place parents in control over what information is collected
                    from their young children online. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from
                    children under thirteen.</p>

                <p>Some countries in the European Union and elsewhere require a minimum age of fourteen or
                    greater. In this event, you must be over the minimum age of consent where you live. To
                    obtain this information, you must contact an appropriate website or qualified and
                    knowledgeable adult where you reside.</p>

                <p>Children who are under the minimum age must have consent from a parent or other adult having
                    parental responsibility. A parent or guardian who becomes aware that his or her child under
                    the minimum age has provided us with Personal Information without prior verifiable parental
                    consent should contact us at support@MusicTeachersAid.com. Upon receipt of this written
                    notice, we will promptly delete any Personal Information from our databases and prevent
                    further access to MusicTeachersAid Services.</p>

                <h3>General data protection regulations</h3>

                <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a comprehensive update to existing
                    European Union privacy laws and is effective as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to
                    companies in the United States and elsewhere that process Personal Information for customers
                    in the European Union. It requires that privacy information be written in clear and plain
                    language and, also, be concise, transparent and easily accessible.</p>

                <p>The data protection regulation also requires a lawful basis for the collecting, storage, use
                    and disclosure of Personal Information. Our lawful basis for processing Personal Information
                    includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Consent – Collecting Personal Information with your consent.</li>
                    <li>Contractual Necessity – Performing the contract we have with you in connection with the
                        Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>Legal – We may be required by law or regulation to collect your data.</li>
                    <li>Legitimate Interests – We may have a good and fair reason to use your data in ways which
                        do not hurt your interests and rights. We may also send you promotional communications
                        about our services.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Controller</h3>

                <p>MusicTeachersAid processes Personal Information both as a processor and a controller as
                    defined in the GDPR. You may contact the Controller by email at
                    controller@MusicTeachersAid.com.</p>
