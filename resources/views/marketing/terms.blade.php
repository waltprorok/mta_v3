                        <h3>Payment Terms for Services</h3>
                        <p>The Fees or charges for using the Services are posted on the Site and are incorporated in
                            this Agreement. MusicTeachersAid has the right to change the Fees or charges at any time and
                            without separate notice to you. There is no charge for the Free Plan. As a Subscriber to the
                            Premium Plan, you must pay the applicable Fees with one of the following: (a) a valid credit
                            card acceptable to us; (b) a valid debit card acceptable to us; (c) PayPal, or (d) by
                            another payment option that MusicTeachersAid may, in its sole judgment, provide to you in
                            writing.</p>

                        <p>If you do not notify us of updates to your payment method (e.g., credit or debit card
                            expiration date or change in card number), to avoid interruption of the Services, we, or our
                            billing service provider, may participate in programs supported by your card provider (e.g.,
                            updater services, recurring billing programs, etc.) to try to update your payment
                            information, and you hereby authorize us to continue billing your Account with the updated
                            information that we obtain.</p>

                        <p>If you sign up for the Premium Plan, you will be billed monthly from the date you create your
                            Premium Plan Account. If you cancel this Premium Plan Account, your account will be billed,
                            and all amounts will be due and payable for your use of the Services as a Premium Plan
                            Subscriber. You may downgrade from the Premium Plan at any time, to stop your Subscription
                            from auto-renewing at the end of the current billing cycle. Services are billed on a monthly
                            or annual basis and the amount billed is non-refundable. There will be no refunds for
                            partial billing periods of Service.</p>

                        <p>All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you
                            shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, and/or duties. All Fees shall be
                            at the foreign equivalent to the US Dollar amount charged. We are not responsible for
                            currency differences or other costs or fees imposed by third parties or governmental
                            entities.
                            Additional ordering, payment, cancellation or renewal terms may be provided to you on the
                            Site or in communications or notices from us, and the Terms of Services incorporate such
                            terms by reference.</p>

                        <h3>Downgrade or Cancellation of Services</h3>
                        <p>You may downgrade from your Premium Plan account to a Free Plan account at any time. This
                            downgrade will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle and your Subscription
                            will not be automatically renewed. You may elect to delete your account and related data at
                            any time; however, if you are in the middle of the Premium Plan billing cycle and you choose
                            to delete your account, you will forfeit any remaining time on the Premium Plan, and no
                            refund will be made.</p>

                        <p>In the event you elect to delete your account, all data, posts and other content cannot be
                            recovered unless we are obligated or elect to retain such content pursuant to the terms of
                            this Agreement. For example, we will retain your content upon your cancellation of the
                            Services if we are under a legal obligation to retain the content, such as in connection
                            with a court order or subpoena. Upon cancellation, you will be responsible for the
                            maintenance and existence of any social media outlet for which you were using the
                            Services.</p>
